**Causes of Vessel Collision Accidents**

Collisions at sea are overwhelmingly attributed to human negligence. 

**Key Causes of Collisions**
</div>

1. **Improver lookout:**
    - The failure to maintain a proper lookout accounts for 54% of collisions. This negligence can result in missed opportunities to detect and avoid nearby vessels.
2. **Improper Command and Supervision:**
    - Negligence in bridge management, such as failing to adhere to service regulations, can increase the likelihood of collisions.
3. **Fatigue:**
    - Fatigue among crew members reduces reaction times and impairs judgment, making accidents more likely.
4. **Excessive Vessel Speed**
    - Traveling at unsafe speeds limits the time and space available for maneuvering, increasing collision risk.
5. **Breach of Steering and Sailing Rules:**
    - Violating navigation rules contributes to 19% of collisions. These breaches often involve improper maneuvering, especially in crossing situations or in restricted visibility.
6. **Breach of Rules on Sound and Light Signals:**
    - Failure to use sound and light signals effectively can lead to confusion and accidents, especially during low visibility.  
7. **Non-Display of Navigational Lights, Shapes, or Flags:**
    - Proper signaling is crucial for communication between vessels. Failure to display these can lead to dangerous misunderstandings.
