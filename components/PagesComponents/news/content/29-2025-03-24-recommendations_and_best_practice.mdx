### Recommendations and best practice by IUMI.

<div className='news-paragraph'>
The International Union of Marine Insurance (IUMI) represents 42 national and marine
market insurance and reinsurance associations prepared recommendations for EV transportation
by Ro-Ro and Car-Carrier vessels.

In light of the safety systems incorporated into EVs, new cars present a lower risk as
compared to used vehicles. There are currently no documented cases of factory-new
electric vehicles causing a fire on board. In contrast, used cars may have had accidents
causing mechanical damages which may negatively impact the intactness of the battery
pack.

➛ A clear policy on the cargo which is accepted/rejected for roro
spaces should be in place. Vehicles should be screened, and used/second-hand
vehicles in particular should be carefully checked before being allowed on board.
If there is suspicion that the battery of an EV is damaged or defective they
should only be allowed if their battery is removed and if they are free from leakages.
IMDG Special Provisions 961 and 962 address requirements for vehicles
which are being carried on board a transport vessel.

**Charging on board**
</div>

<div className='news-paragraph' style={{marginLeft: '20px'}}>
➛ Ro-Ro : Charging on board ro-ro passenger ships can be permitted if the ship operator
conducts a comprehensive risk assessment and approves and implements
appropriate risk control measures. Research indicates that charging an
EV on board is the safer option as inbuilt safety mechanisms are activated during
charging. As mentioned above, information regarding safe charging on board
is available in the EMSA Guidance on the carriage of AFVs in RO-RO spaces.

➛ Car Carrier : are not fitted with charging stations.

**Detection & confirmation/verification**
</div>

<div className='news-paragraph' style={{marginLeft: '20px'}}>
➛ Detection and verification/confirmation of a fire is key to enable
successful firefighting operations. These two steps should not be considered as
separate but as one step. Time between detection and confirmation/verification
must be reduced to the shortest possible time. The installation of technologies
which enhance early detection are therefore supported for these vessel types.
Options include gas detection systems, thermal imaging cameras, and AI powered
systems.

**Firefighting**
</div>

<div className='news-paragraph' style={{marginLeft: '20px'}}>
➛ Ro-Ro : The EU’s LASHFIRE project has shown that drencher systems are effective
to fight fires on board roro and ropax vessels. Full scale tests show that a
drencher system has the same impact on the fire regardless of the source of the
fire being an fuel oil car or an EV. Drencher systems are thus effective to manage
and control EV fires.

This is reflected in the revised requirements developed by the IMO’s Sub-Committee
on Ship Systems and Equipment (SSE). The amendments to SOLAS and
the Fire Safety Systems (FSS) Code will mainly apply to new passenger ships
and include, inter alia, requirements for a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system
to be provided for the area on the weather deck intended for the carriage of
vehicles; an effective video monitoring system; and a fixed water-based fire-extinguishing
system based on monitor(s) to be installed in order to cover weather
decks intended for the carriage of vehicles.

➛ Car Carrier : CO2 extinguishing systems if applied quickly after the detection and
verification/confirmation of a fire have worked successfully to fight fires on board
Car Carrier. To further improve the usefulness, the CO2 capacity should be doubled
on board Car Carrier. Research projects are ongoing to methodically assess and
evaluate the effectiveness of the CO2 extinguishing systems.

➛ Car Carrier: Research indicates that while high-expansion foam fire extinguishing
systems were unable to stop thermal runaway (like any other fixed systems), it
hindered the ignition of flammable gas, including gaseous electrolyte from the
batteries. The system effectively prevented heat transmission from a vehicle on
fire as long as it was submerged in the foam. This suggests the potential effectiveness
of high-expansion foam fire extinguishing systems.

➛ Car Carriers: Early detection, confirmation/verification and a short response time are
crucial to fight a fire successfully. The fixed firefighting systems should be applied
first rather than manual firefighting by the crew.

**Overarching approach**
</div>

<div className='news-paragraph' style={{marginLeft: '20px'}}>
➛ Car Carrier and RoRo: Different design, resources, equipment and circumstances
have to be considered for each vessel. Individual risk assessments and tactics
are essential to ensure an effective response in case of a fire on board.
The IMO’s Sub-Committee on Ship Systems and Equipment (SSE) will start work on the
“Evaluation of adequacy of fire protection, detection and extinction arrangements in vehicle,
special category and ro-ro spaces in order to reduce the fire risk of ships carrying
new energy vehicles” beginning in March 2024. The regulatory process will be an opportunity
to improve safety requirements making them fit for the new reality of large numbers
of alternative fuel vehicles being carried on board vessels.
