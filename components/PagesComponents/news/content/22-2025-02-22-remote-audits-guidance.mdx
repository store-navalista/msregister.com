### **Development of guidance on remote methods for surveys ISM Code audits and ISPS Code verifications**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
Sub-Committee on Implementation of IMO Instruments (III), on Session 10 following two resolutions on Survey guidelines under the Harmonized System of Survey and Certification (HSSC), 2023 (resolution A.1186(33)), and 2023 Guidelines on implementation of the International Safety Management (ISM) Code by Administrations (resolution A.1188(33)), which included provisions for remote surveys and ISM Code audits, advanced its work on developing draft guidance on assessments and applications of remote surveys, ISM Code audits and ISPS Code verifications, together with the associated MSC-MEPC circular.

The guidance addresses the need for harmonization of requirements for the use of remote methods for surveys, ISM Code audits, and ISPS Code verifications falling within the scope of the Harmonized System for Survey and Certification (HSSC), the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, and the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, as amended.

The Sub-Committee was of the view that interim ISM audits should be conducted in-person, except for interim DOC (document of compliance) audits when a new ship type is to be added to an existing document of compliance. The Sub-Committee was also of the view that the use of remote ISPS verification in lieu of in-person attendance should be limited to extraordinary circumstances, taking into account the highly sensitive nature of the information addressed in ISPS verifications.

The Sub-Committee re-established the Correspondence Group on Survey Guidelines under the HSSC, the Non-exhaustive List of Obligations, and the Guidance on Remote Surveys, Audits and Verifications to further develop the guidance.

The guidance is expected to be finalized at the next session for subsequent submission to MSC and MEPC for consideration and approval, as appropriate.
