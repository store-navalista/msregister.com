### **New Installations of VHF, MF/HF radio installations and Inmarsat-C ship earth stations**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
[MSC.1/Circ.1676](https://maritime.lr.org/l/941163/2023-12-14/8z5rj/941163/1702552480ihTS8BZg/MSC.1_Circ.1676_Delays_Affecting_The_Availability_Of_New_Gmdss_Equipme.pdf) invites flag Administrations to permit the continued installation of such equipment approved to the older performance standards until 1 January 2028.

New installations of such equipment installed after 1 January 2028 must conform to performance standards specified in the annexes to resolutions MSC.511(105), MSC.512(105) and MSC.513(105).

### **Existing VHF radio installations**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
[MSC.1/Circ.1460/Rev.4](https://maritime.lr.org/l/941163/2023-12-14/8z5sx/941163/1702558009CTFL7Duk/MSC.1_Circ.1460_Rev.4.pdf) effectively moves the compliance date for VHF radiocommunication equipment to meet the new channelling requirements from 1 January 2024 to the first radio survey after 1 January 2028.

The amended Appendix 18 requires 4-digit channels rather than the previous 2-digit channels.

For newer VHF equipment, which is not already compatible with the amended RR, compatibility might be achieved by a software update. Older VHF equipment may have to be replaced.

### **HF GMDSS equipment capable of operating narrow-band direct printing (NBDP)**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
The requirements of SOLAS Chapter IV related to provision of HF direct-printing telegraphy (NBDP) equipment will effectively be deleted when the revised Chapter IV enters into force on 1 January 2024. As such, any requirements related to HF NBDP have been removed from the recently published MSC.1/Circ.1460/Rev.4.

### **What we advise shipowners and ship operators to do now**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
Owners and operators should confirm with their VHF GMDSS radiocommunications installation manufacturer whether software updates or replacement equipment are needed, ahead of the new 2028 deadline.
