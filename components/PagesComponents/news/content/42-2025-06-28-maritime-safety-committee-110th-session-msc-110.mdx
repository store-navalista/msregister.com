1\. Amendments to mandatory instruments 

The Committee is expected to consider, with a view to adoption, draft amendments to several mandatory instruments, including draft amendments to: SOLAS chapter II-1 to include a new definition of "gaseous fuel" in addition to the existing definition of "low-flashpoint fuel"; SOLAS chapter V concerning pilot transfer arrangements, the IMSBC Code and the IGC Code. 

2\. Development of a goal-based instrument for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS)  

Taking into account the information shared during the symposium co-organized by IMO and Norway on 17 June, the Committee will consider the report of the MASS Correspondence Group and will establish a MASS Working Group. It is expected to progress the finalization of several chapters of the draft MASS Code. 

3\. Development of a GHG safety regulatory framework

The Committee will continue its work to develop a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels, and is expected to: 
- outline a list of priorities as a guide to instruct the appropriate sub-committees to progress the work on specific identified alternative fuels or new technologies;  
- consider the implementation of the “one ship, one code” policy in the context of potential regulatory challenges faced by gas carriers using alternative low-flashpoint fuels that are not carried as cargo; and 
- consider the proposed revision of the IMO’s Code of Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships and the further cooperation with IAEA and other relevant IMO bodies.  

4\. Matters related to the International Safety Management Code

The Committee will consider several matters related to the International Safety Management Code, including: the proposal for a new output on the review of the Code; the outcome of the considerations on violence and harassment by the Joint ILO/IMO Working Group; and recommendations emanating from the Study on the effectiveness and implementation of the ISM Code.  

In addition, proposals concerning the challenges with the implementation and enforcement of seafarers' hours of work and rest will also be considered. 

5\. Cyber risk management and enhancing maritime security  

The Committee will consider further steps (e.g. cybersecurity standards) to enhance maritime cybersecurity. Discussions will cover the use of international maritime information-sharing centres to enhance maritime security.   

6\. Piracy and armed robbery against ships  

The Committee will hear an update on developments related to piracy and armed robbery against ships. An overview of 2024 piracy reports show a slight decrease in cases, compared to 2023. In 2024, 146 incidents were reported to IMO (attempted and occurred) compared to 150 in 2023 (3% drop, globally).  

Most affected areas were the Straits of Malacca and Singapore area (91), Indian Ocean (19), West Africa (17), South China Sea (10), Arabian Sea (7), followed by South America (Caribbean) (1) and South America (Atlantic) (1). 

The number of reported incidents has picked back up in the first part of 2025, with 109 reported incidents between 1 January and 17 June 2025.   

The Committee will discuss further actions to address these developments.  

7\. Reports of Sub-Committees 

The Committee will consider the reports from the following Sub-Committees and take relevant decisions: 

- Sub-Committee on carriage of cargoes and containers (CCC 10) 

The Committee will consider a draft resolution on Revised Recommendations for entering enclosed spaces aboard ships, with a view to adoption. 

- Sub-Committee on navigation, communications and search and rescue (NCSR 12, urgent matters) 

The Committee is expected to approve draft amendments to SOLAS regulations concerning the requirement for dissemination of maritime safety information and search and rescue-related information through all operational recognized mobile satellite services. 

The Committee is also expected to approve draft amendments to SOLAS chapter V and the appendix to introduce the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) and consequential amendments to existing instruments, including the 1994 and 2000 HSC Codes. 

- Sub-Committee on ship systems and equipment (SSE 11) 

The Committee will consider draft amendments to the Life Saving Appliances (LSA) Code, regarding design of the arrangements for the simulated launch of free-fall lifeboats; as well as issues related to unified interpretations. 

- Sub-Committee on human element, training and watchkeeping (HTW 11) 

The Committee will consider a road map, alternative to the road map prepared by the Sub-Committee, to expedite the completion of the comprehensive review of the STCW Convention and Code and discuss a course of action concerning the communication of information provisions (STCW regulation I/7) and their relationship with the IMO Member State Audit Scheme (IMSAS). 

- Ship design and construction (SDC 11) 

The Committee will discuss, among other issues, the scope of the ongoing revision of the Interim Guidelines on Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP); and the matter related to the unified interpretation of the provisions in SOLAS regarding emergency escape trunks.
