### **Amendments to the  ESP Code – Revised Tank Inspection Requirement for Bulk Carriers**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
To align with the latest revision of the ESP Code (as amended by IMO Res. MSC.525(106)) and IACS Unified Requirements (UR Z10.1/.2/.4/.5), updated the periodical survey requirements. These new requirements will be in force for surveys commenced on or after 1 July 2024.

The following changes are to be observed:

**Bulk carriers**
</div>

- The ballast tank coating condition for bulk carriers with ESP notation will now be identical to the criteria applicable for oil tankers. This means that a coating condition rated less than “GOOD” (i.e. “FAIR” or “POOR”) shall be recorded for examination at subsequent annual surveys.
- An annual examination will be implemented after the first renewal or intermediate survey (commenced on or after 1 July 2024) if the coating condition is not restored to “GOOD”.
- Double-skin void spaces bounding cargo holds in bulk carriers exceeding 20 years of age and 150 metres in length shall be examined annually if the protective coating is found to be “POOR”.
- New requirements have been introduced to the annual survey of double-skin void spaces, when applicable, for bulk carriers exceeding 20 years of age and 150 metres in length.

**Recommendations**
</div>

<div className='news-paragraph'>
Given the updated requirements, it is strongly recommended that the coating condition of water ballast tanks and doubleside skin void spaces on bulk carriers undergo continuous maintenance.
