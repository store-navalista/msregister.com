## IMO approves Net-Zero pollution prevention regulations for Global Shipping

<div className='news-paragraph'>
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has approved a landmark set of draft regulations aimed at achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by or around 2050. These measures, endorsed during the 83rd session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 83) held from April 7–11, 2025, represent a significant advancement in global maritime decarbonization efforts.

**Key Components of the IMO Net-Zero Framework**

The approved framework introduces two pivotal elements:
</div>

1. **Global Fuel Standard:** A phased reduction in the annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) of ships, calculated on a well-to-wake basis. This standard mandates a gradual decrease in the amount of GHG emitted per unit of energy used, promoting the adoption of cleaner fuels and technologies.
2. **Global Economic Measure:** An emissions pricing mechanism requiring ships exceeding GFI thresholds to acquire remedial units to offset their emissions. Conversely, vessels employing zero or near-zero GHG technologies will be eligible for financial incentives, fostering innovation and the transition to sustainable maritime operations.

These regulations will be incorporated into a new Chapter 5 of MARPOL Annex VI and are set to become mandatory for ocean-going vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage—accounting for approximately 85% of CO₂ emissions from international shipping. Formal adoption is anticipated in October 2025, with enforcement commencing in 2027.

**Implementation Timeline**
</div>

- **October 2025:** Formal adoption of the regulations.
- **2027:** Entry into force of the mandatory measures.

**Implications for Surveyors and Technical Staff**

Surveyors and technical personnel should put increased emphasis on accurate documentation and reporting of fuel usage and emissions data.

**Other MEPC 83 outcomes**

The meeting discussed a range of issues related to protecting the marine environment from shipping activities, with the following key outcomes:
</div>

- Adoption of 2025 Action Plan to combat marine plastic litter;
- Progress in the review of the Ballast Water Management Convention;
- Approval of a proposal to designate the North-East Atlantic as an Emission Control Area and agreement in principle to designate two new Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas off South America’s Pacific coast;
- Approval of the draft Work plan on the development of a regulatory framework for the use of Onboard Carbon Capture Storage systems (OCCS)
- Approval of draft amendments to regulation 27 of MARPOL Annex VI regarding accessibility of the IMO Data Collection System
- Adoption of amendments to the 2021 Guidelines on the operational carbon intensity reduction factors relative to reference lines (CII reduction factors guidelines, G3)
- Approval of a new output to develop a legally binding framework on biofouling management, to prevent the spread of harmful invasive aquatic species
