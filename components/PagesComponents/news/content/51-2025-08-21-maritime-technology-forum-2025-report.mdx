## Maritime Technology Forum 2025 report on the safe carriage of electric vehicles at sea

<div className='news-paragraph'>
As the global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) accelerates, the maritime industry faces a new type of safety challenge. The Maritime Technologies Forum (MTF), a coalition of flag states and classification societies, has sought to address these challenges in its March 2025 report on the safe carriage of electric vehicles at sea. This document aims to bridge the gap between technological innovation and maritime safety regulations, offering guidance for the safe transport of EVs aboard Pure Car and Truck Carriers (PCTCs).

The MTF’s mission is to support the safe and sustainable evolution of maritime technologies by providing expert insight and fostering dialogue between industry and regulators. In the context of EV transportation, the MTF recognises that, while EV adoption is surging globally, maritime safety regulations have not kept pace with the unique risks these vehicles pose when transported by sea.

The rationale behind the report stems from a growing concern over the fire hazards associated with lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), which power most EVs. These batteries are susceptible to a phenomenon known as thermal runaway, this being a self-sustaining chemical reaction that can lead to intense fires, explosions, and the release of toxic gases. As EVs are tightly packed on PCTCs, the risk of fire spreading rapidly is significantly heightened.

Despite these risks, there are currently very few international regulations specifically governing the safe carriage of EVs at sea. Those that do exist are contained within the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG) and deal primarily with the condition of the goods themselves rather than the way in which they are carried. While some national and regional bodies have issued preliminary guidelines, the IMO has only recently begun developing mandatory regulations, with a target completion year of 2027. The MTF’s report is intended to inform and accelerate this regulatory process by providing a detailed analysis of the risks and potential mitigation strategies

#### Key areas of discussion

The report is structured around eight core areas, each addressing a critical aspect of EV transport safety:
1. **Characteristics of EVs and thermal runaway**
 - The report outlines the structure and behaviour of LiBs, emphasizing their high energy density and the dangers of thermal runaway. It explains how even a single battery cell failure can trigger a chain reaction, leading to uncontrollable fires
2. **Early detection**
 - Early identification of abnormal battery conditions is crucial. The report recommends integrating advanced detection systems such as AI-enabled CCTV, infrared cameras, gas detectors, and alerts from EV battery management systems (BMS). These technologies can detect heat, smoke, or gas emissions before a fire breaks out
3. **Explosion prevention**
 - During thermal runaway, flammable gases like hydrogen and methane are released. The report stresses the importance of explosion-proof electrical equipment and continuous mechanical ventilation to prevent gas accumulation in enclosed spaces.
4. **Fire protection and spread prevention**
 - Given the tight stowage of vehicles on PCTCs, fire can spread rapidly. The report suggests using fire blankets, fixed and portable boundary cooling systems or water curtains, and enhancing structural fire protection with higher-rated insulation and updated testing standards. This will help prevent fire spread and assist with safe evacuation of onboard personnel and crew.
5. **Manual firefighting**
 - Manual intervention is most effective in the early stages of a fire. The report discusses the use of water mist lances, thermal imagers, and portable cooling devices, whilst also highlighting the risks to crew safety and the need for proper equipment placement and water drainage systems
6. **Fixed firefighting systems**
 - Though falling short of specific recommendations, the report compares CO₂, high-expansion foam, and water-based systems. While CO₂ is widely used, it lacks cooling capability and poses asphyxiation risks. Foam systems offer cooling and smothering effects but may degrade under heat. Water-based systems provide continuous cooling but require careful management to avoid stability issues.
7. **Crew safety during firefighting**
 - Protecting crew members is paramount. The report recommends enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE), sufficient breathing apparatus, and improved ventilation strategies. It also calls for better lighting, communication tools, and escape route protection
8. **Training and drills**
 - Effective response hinges on preparedness. The report advocates for regular training and drills tailored to EV fire scenarios, including understanding fire behaviour, using firefighting equipment, and executing evacuation procedures

### Impact on the maritime industry

The MTF report purports to play a role in shaping the future of maritime EV transport regulations. By offering a detailed, evidence-based framework, the report provides support to the IMO as it works toward developing a comprehensive regulatory framework. The report also serves as a catalyst for innovation and collaboration. The report’s emphasis on early detection and advanced firefighting systems is likely to drive technological advancements tailored to the unique challenges of EV transport.

Whilst the report is “guidance”, it underscores the importance of cross-industry cooperation, particularly between the maritime and automotive sectors, to develop standardised safety features and communication protocols. By raising awareness and promoting accountability across the supply chain, the MTF’s work fosters a culture of shared responsibility and continuous improvement in maritime safety.

Beyond regulatory developments, the report has immediate implications for vessel operations. There can be no doubt that LiB related incidents are increasingly the subject of litigation, with submissions typically centring on the seaworthiness (by way of cargo-worthiness) of the carrying vessel. With vessel owners and operators encouraged to adopt the report’s recommendations proactively rather than waiting for formal mandates, it is not yet clear how the courts will interpret such guidance. Implementing the report’s recommendations may significantly reduce the risk of catastrophic incidents involving EVs at sea. However, it remains to be seen whether, by failing to do so, vessel operators risk falling foul of their contractual obligations as carriers.

### Conclusion

The MTF’s 2025 report on the safe carriage of electric vehicles is a timely contribution to maritime safety. However, whilst this report provides a clear, actionable roadmap for reducing the risks associated with EV transport, the impact they will have prior to regulatory or class codification remains unclear. Vessel and cargo owners alike would be well advised to keep abreast of judicial and arbitral developments when deciding how to conduct their operations in this interim period.
