## Safety standard for surveyors

### IACS releases new guidelines on safety standards for surveyors

<div className='news-paragraph'>
IACS has introduced new recommendations to enhance safety standards for surveyors.
The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) has introduced new recommendations to enhance safety standards for surveyors.
The new guidelines, Rec. 184, recognise that surveyors continue to face significant occupational health and safety (OHS) risks at work.
There is growing recognition that some of the safety challenges that surveyorsâ€™ face would benefit from improved collaboration and sharing of experience to establish a more consistent approach.
Designed to creating safer working conditions for surveyors and all personnel engaged in maritime operations, these guidelines outline critical measures to mitigate risks and addresses key areas such as risk assessments and situational awareness, ensuring that they are equipped to handle the hazards they may encounter.
By introducing these guidelines, IACS aims to enhance OHS standards, prioritising the safety and well-being of surveyors and all associated personnel. This initiative supports the development of consistent OHS practices across classification societies and contributes to a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.

Key highlights of the guidelines include:
- Comprehensive Risk Management: The document provides guidance for surveyors to exercise appropriate risk assessment and situational awareness prior to commencing work for prevention of accidents, near-misses, injury or ill health to surveyors, associated personnel and damage to property.
- Increased Focus on Collaboration: IACS encourages surveyors to share experiences and safety challenges to improve the overall safety culture across the maritime industry.
- Fitness for Work: The guidelines emphasize the importance of physical and mental readiness, including undertaking all periodical medical checkups required by their society.
- Fatigue Management: The guidelines stress the importance of ensuring adequate rest to prevent fatigue, which can impair performance and increase the risk of accidents.
- Empowering Surveyors to Use Stop Work Authority: Surveyors are empowered to stop work if they believe safety conditions are at risk, ensuring that corrective measures are taken before continuing with tasks.
- Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): The guidelines mandate the use of appropriate PPE and provide instructions on the maintenance and replacement of worn or damaged gear.
- Standardised Safety Practices: The guidelines reinforce the importance of uniform safety practices, ensuring that surveyors adhere to a consistent set of safety protocols regardless of the work environment.
The guidelines further address activities that pose elevated OHS risks for surveyors, providing tailored recommendations to enhance safety. These include working at height, transfers between boats, and performing surveys in confined spaces or using rafts. The document also covers managing pressure tests, control of stored/electrical energy, and participation in sea trials. Additionally, it highlights precautions for exposure to extreme weather conditions, hazardous materials, and travel-related safety concerns, ensuring surveyors are equipped to navigate the varied risks associated with their roles.
