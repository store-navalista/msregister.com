Stage 1: Please submit the following information to Recognized Organisations (RO)  by email no later than 15 December 2025: 
- Number of vessels in your fleet that called into EU & UK ports during the 2025   calendar year
- Number of voyages for each of the vessel(s) listed above.

Stage 2: Please submit the data for each ship identified in stage 1 and the relevant supporting documents using the [Emissions Verifier portal](https://emissionsverifier.lr.org/login?_gl=1*1gafnas*_gcl_au*ODQxNDg4NzYzLjE3NTk3MzI5MjI.*_ga*MTE3MzQ4NTQ2Ny4xNzAzNjEyNTcx*_ga_BTRFH3E7GD*czE3NjMzOTA2NzAkbzE3MDAkZzEkdDE3NjMzOTA2OTYkajM0JGwwJGgxNzU4MDUyMjg4) by 15 January 2026. 

For further details on the data submission and supporting document requirements, please refer to the [MRV Evidence Pack](https://maritime.lr.org/l/941163/2023-10-05/8ggbx/941163/1696507273wtwUnaoB/IMO_Data_Collection_System___MRV_Regulations_Evidence_Pack.pdf) & [FuelEU Evidence Pack](https://maritime.lr.org/FuelEU-Evidence-Pack) in the Emissions Verifier portal.

**IMO DCS & CII verification deadline **

Annual emissions data and relevant supporting evidence should be submitted to RO in the Emissions Verifier portal on or before 31 March 2026. Please refer to the [IMO DCS & CII Evidence Pack](https://maritime.lr.org/l/941163/2024-07-22/bjlb7/941163/1721661683SQMcBbsZ/IMO_Data_Collection_System_Verification_Evidence_Pack_Rev_1_01_Sept_20.pdf) in the Emissions Verifier portal, which lists the supporting documents and reports required for LR to initiate the verification.

#### **Submission deadlines**

**FuelEU**
- 31 January 2026 – The ship-specific FuelEU report submitted to your accredited verifier.
- 31 March 2026 – Ship-specific FuelEU report to be verified
- 30 April 2026 – FuelEU report data to be marked as verified in THETIS by your accredited verifier and, as applicable, the flexibility mechanism recorded in THETIS.

For full FuelEU compliance timelines, including issuance of Document of Compliance and payment of penalties (as applicable), please see the [FuelEU Timetable for Compliance](https://www.lr.org/en/services/statutory-compliance/fueleu-regulation/timetable-for-compliance/).

**EU MRV**
- 31 March 2026 – Ship and company level emissions data should be submitted to THETIS platform and marked as verified by an accredited verifier.

NOTE: Administering Authorities (AA) may request verified data to be submitted earlier than 31 March (but not before 28 February). 

**EU ETS**
- 31 March 2026 – Verified company level emissions data (reported in THETIS under EU MRV) is to be entered into the Union Registry by a regulated entity using a Maritime Operator Holding Account (MOHA). The data must be marked as verified (again) by the AA/accredited verifier.

If not submitted by 1 April 2026, the MOHA will be blocked.

NOTE: If a shipping company no longer falls under the scope of EU ETS (e.g. it stops calling at EU/EEA ports or ceases operations for a reporting year), it may request the AA to set its MOHA to “excluded” status. See MOHA's and the Union Registry for more details.

**UK MRV**
- 30 April 2026 – Data must be verified by an accredited verifier. 

NOTE: The UK has no access to the EU’s THETIS-MRV database. An alternative UK reporting platform remains pending. Therefore, verified data should be held (for LR this is within the Emissions Verifier) until such time that the UK’s digital platform is operational.

**MO DCS & CII**
- 31 March 2026 – Annual emissions data to be submitted to the verifier.
- 31 May 2026 – Annual emissions data to be verified and a Statement of Compliance issued on behalf of the Administration.
- 30 June 2026 – Submission of verified data into the IMO GISIS platforms on behalf of the Administration by the verifier.
