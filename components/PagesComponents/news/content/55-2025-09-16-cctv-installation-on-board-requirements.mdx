## CCTV Installation on Board Requirements

<div className='news-paragraph'>
India’s Directorate General of Shipping issued a Merchant Shipping Notice in February 2025 requiring CCTV installation on all newbuild and existing Indian flagged vessels of 500gt or more. It also recommends the installation of CCTV on all 500gt+ foreign-flagged ships calling at Indian ports. Mandated vessels must comply by 12 February 2028, or at their next classification renewal survey, whichever occurs later.

The ruling follows a series of high-profile incidents – including crew disappearances, man-overboard incidents, and collisions – where the absence of real-time situational awareness technologies has resulted in accidents or thwarted search and rescue efforts.

The Indian government cites several cases where limited visibility over shipboard activity delayed emergency response and SAR (Interrnational Convention on Marine Search and Rescue) coordination and increased the likelihood of fatalities. It says the installation of CCTV is “recognised as a highly effective measure to enhance onboard safety and security.

**Assessment**

Vessel owners and International Safety Management (ISM) managers, in coordination with the ship’s Master, must conduct a thorough assessment to design a vessel-specific CCTV system. This assessment should focus on vulnerabilities, optimal camera placement, and coverage of critical areas such as ship-side railings, common spaces, and isolated locations. For tankers, the system must comply with safety standards for hazardous zones.

**Recommended Camera Placement**

The notice provides a comprehensive table recommending the placement of CCTV cameras in key areas, including:
- Port and Starboard Main Decks
- Forecastle, Mooring, and Stern Areas
- Navigation Bridge (optional technology for incident analysis)
- Citadel
- Accommodation Exteriors and Lifeboat Decks

The minimum number of cameras varies based on vessel size and type, with a requirement ranging from 4 cameras for vessels below 3,000 GT to 12 cameras for those exceeding 10,000 GT.

**Compliance and Timeline**
- Existing Indian-flagged vessels and foreign-flagged vessels under SPL must comply within 36 months or by their next renewal survey, whichever is later.
- Newly registered Indian-flagged vessels must comply within 36 months of registration.
- Newly constructed Indian-flagged vessels must install CCTV systems prior to delivery.

**Technical Specifications**

To ensure reliability and effectiveness, the CCTV systems must meet the following technical specifications:
- Minimum 1080p Full HD resolution with at least 30 fps frame rate
- IP66/IP67/IP68-rated cameras for open deck installations
- In machinery spaces, the cameras should be able to withstand higher temperatures and preferably have thermal detection
- Storage capacity of at least 14 days

Furthermore, the CCTV system must integrate with the vessel’s IT infrastructure while adhering to cyber risk management protocols. Signage must be displayed in common areas to notify crew and visitors about surveillance, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

The directive recommends the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) or system-based software to enhance monitoring capabilities. These technologies can enable real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, advanced automated alerts, and reduce reliance on manual oversight.

**Inspection and Maintenance**

CCTV systems should be inspected weekly and serviced annually, with maintenance records available for audit.

**Training Guidelines**

To maximize operational efficiency, the directive includes training guidelines:
- The Master or safety officer and security officer should be familiar with the CCTV operation and monitoring.
- Crew members should be trained to use the system when they join the vessel and during man-overboard, search and rescue (SAR), and security drills.
- The Designated Person Ashore (DPA) and ISM manager should be familiar with shore-based monitoring and response.

**Compliance Review**
- Vessels equipped with existing CCTV systems at the time of the notice’s issuance will be deemed compliant but should be reviewed for adequacy.
- Equipment malfunctions will not be considered deficiencies during flag state or port state control inspections.
- Access to recorded data is restricted to the vessel, its ISM managers, DPA, and owners. External entities, including port authorities, cannot access footage unless authorized by the DGS.

The Directorate General of Shipping recommends the adoption of AI-enabled software to enhance monitoring capabilities, specifying strategic CCTV placement around the ship’s main deck, forecastle, mooring and stern areas, bridge and superstructure.
