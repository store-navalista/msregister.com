According to the SEEMP Part III, companies must ensure that affected vessels meet the energy efficiency targets set by the IMO. This will be accomplished through a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) which is subject to company audits, as per MARPOL Annex VI Reg. 26.

Relevant for all ship types of 5000 GRT and above except category A ships as defined in the Polar Code.
</div>

### **How to manage the SEEMP company audit – overall principles**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
The SEEMP company audit shall be carried out at least once every three years. To minimize the administrative burden on the company, the SEEMP audit may be combined with ISM DOC audits.
</div>

### **Scope of SEEMP audits**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
SEEMP audits – including the process for execution, reporting and corrective actions – shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures used for ISM Code or Seamless™ service audits (for more info see below link in references).

At the fleet level, the audit will focus on the company’s policy and approach for implementation, monitoring, self-assessment, improvement, corrective actions and measures to ensure energy efficiency targets are met. In addition, the SEEMP implementation for individual vessels will be assessed on a sampling basis.

A periodical shipboard audit is not required.
</div>

### **Preparation for SEEMP audits**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
To comply with the regulation, the company should ensure the following measures are implemented:
</div>

- **Compliance verification**
    - Includes verification that the Confirmation of Compliance has been issued and remedial action for non-compliance has been taken, and that all personnel identified in the SEEMP are aware of their roles, responsibilities and duties, have received appropriate training, and are receiving the necessary support and resources to fulfil their roles.
- **Operational adherence**
    - Confirmation that each sampled ship in the fleet is operated in accordance with the SEEMP Part III, regardless of its rating, and that the implementation of the measures is progressing according to the plan. It will also include evaluating the contribution of each measure to the CII impact, monitoring the CII and ensuring all procedures associated with the SEEMP Part III are followed.
- **Progress on corrective actions**
    - Confirmation that the company has demonstrated progress on corrective actions (for vessels rated “D” for three consecutive years or rated “E” for one year) within the three-year implementation plan and the plan of corrective actions.
- **Self-assessment and improvement**
    - Confirmation that the company has conducted self-assessment and improvement of actions according to the plan.
- **Assignment of responsibilities**
    - Verification that the company has ensured the assignment of responsibilities related to the implementation and monitoring of measures according to the plan, the availability of resources, the familiarity with the plan and training.
