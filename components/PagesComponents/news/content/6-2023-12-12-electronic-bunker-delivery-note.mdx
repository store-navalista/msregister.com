The IMO has formally confirmed the use of Bunker Delivery Notes (BDNs) in electronic format as an acceptable alternative to the conventional hard copy, as long as they conform to the regulations of MARPOL Annex VI.

This follows the 80th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee, which agreed an additional unified interpretation to regulations 18.5 and 18.6 of MARPOL Annex VI concerning BDNs. It is now included in the updated consolidation circular [MEPC.1/Circ.795/Rev.8](https://maritime.lr.org/l/941163/2024-01-09/92x9r/941163/17047929504kVJVkJH/MEPC.1_Circ.795_Rev.8_Unified_Interpretations_To_Marpol_Annex_Vi_Secre.pdf).

### **Bunker Delivery Note (BDN)**

<div className='news-paragraph'>
The updated interpretation relating to regulation 18.5 and 18.6 can be read in full below. 

The minimum information to be contained in the BDN remains the same in hard copy or electronic format and is given in Appendix V of MARPOL Annex VI (also shown below).

An electronic BDN as supplied should also be protected against any edits/modifications/revisions and a verification method used to make authentication possible. See interpretation for Regulation 18 MEPC.1/Circ.795/Rev.8, below.

A BDN in electronic format must equally be retained onboard for a period of not less than three years from the date of delivery and made readily available for inspection as required.

Certain ports are looking to implement electronic BDNs as part of a wider move towards digitalisation, including documentation related to bunkering operations. Ship officers should be aware of these changes such as the method to digitally transfer an electronic BDN from the bunker barge to the receiving ship and the subsequent means to securely retain that electronic record onboard for not less than the required time period.
