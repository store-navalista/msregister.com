## Proper Maintenance and Rigging of Pilot Transfer Arrangements

<div className='news-paragraph'>
Recent reports and Port State Control (PSC) inspections have highlighted recurring issues related to Pilot transfer arrangements. 
Pilot ladders and hoist/pilot transfer arrangements, the improper rigging of pilot transfer arrangements. 

In 2020, there were 197 deficiencies, and 1 detention related to pilot transfer arrangements. By 2024, these were numbers had risen sharply to 523 deficiencies and 12 detentions. This significant increase is a cause for concern and underscores the urgent need for ship’s crew and operators to take prompt corrective action. 
Despite previous safety bulletins addressing concerns such as the use of D-shackles for securing the pilot ladders, several other issues continue to persist. These include: 
- Failure to properly secure pilot ladders and accommodation ladders to the ship’s side 
- Inadequate securing of stanchions with locking pins 
- General complacency regarding ladder maintenance 
- Lack of clear identification and differentiation between pilot ladders and other types of ladders 

These repeated issues suggest a need for improved crew training and awareness regarding pilot ladders and pilot transfer arrangements. 
Separately, a Focused Inspection Campaign (FIC) was also carried out by the Tokyo MOU member Authorities in February 2025 on Pilot Ladders / Pilot Transfer Arrangements. During the campaign period, a total of 2,357 inspections were conducted. Three ships were detained and 176 deficiencies related to the FIC were identified on 169 ships.
The requirements for pilot transfer arrangements are outlined in SOLAS Chapter V, Regulation 23 and supporting standards, including: 
- IMO MSC.1/Circ.1331 – Guidelines for pilot transfer arrangements 
- IMO RES. A.1045(27) – Recommendation on pilot transfer arrangements 
- ISO 799-1:2019 – Standard for pilot ladder construction and specifications 

According to SOLAS V/23.3.3.1, a pilot ladder must be used when a pilot is required to climb between 1.5 to 9.0 metres. The regulation mandates specific design, construction, and certification standards for pilot ladders.
Pilot ladders are uniquely constructed in accordance with SOLAS/ISO standards and include features such as spreaders for safety. It is essential that all crew members: 
- Understand how to identify pilot ladders from other types of ladders 
- Are familiar with proper rigging procedures in line with SOLAS and IMO/ISO guidelines 
- Conduct regular checks and maintenance to ensure equipment integrity 
- Remain vigilant and proactive to avoid complacency in safety-critical tasks 

The ISM company should ensure that risks, control measures, safety procedures, training and maintenance provisions of pilot ladder and pilot ladder transfer arrangement are documented in their Safety Management System, and Planned Maintenance System and effectively implemented consistently across the fleet. 
Flag States and/or the Recognised Organisations should ensure that during surveys and inspections, pilot transfer arrangements are surveyed/inspected, which includes ensuring crew are sufficiently familiar with the rigging the pilot transfer arrangement.
