The International Maritime Organization is stepping up efforts to prepare seafarers for shipping’s energy transition, in line with its [strategy](https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/environment/pages/2023-imo-strategy-on-reduction-of-ghg-emissions-from-ships.aspx) to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships. 

IMO has issued Generic interim guidelines on training for seafarers on ships using alternative fuels and new technologies \([STCW 7/ Circ. 25](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/MediaCentre/Documents/STCW.7-Circ.25.pdf)\). The guidelines set out an international framework for the development and approval of training of seafarers serving on all ships using alternative fuels and new technologies.

Fuel- and technology- specific interim training guidelines - including for methyl/ethyl alcohol, ammonia, hydrogen, LPG, battery-powered ships and fuel cells - are also being developed. They will be considered by the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Human Element, Training and Watchkeeping in February 2026 (HTW 12).  

These guidelines are expected to form the basis for mandatory requirements for seafarer training under the revised [1978 STCW Convention Code](https://www.imo.org/en/ourwork/humanelement/pages/stcw-convention.aspx), currently under [review](https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/pages/whatsnew-2037.aspx) to support decarbonisation, digitalisation and other developments. 

Developing capacity through technical support

Along with regulations, IMO is expanding its support to Member States. Examples of ongoing initiatives include:  
- A three-year project funded by Japan to train instructors from Asian countries in operating LNG-fuelled ships; 
- A [partnership](https://docs.imo.org/Shared/Download.aspx?did=155881) with the World Maritime University to produce training materials for seafarers on alternative fuels, which also contributed to the Maritime Just Transition Task Force [training frameworks](https://www.mjttf.org/Reports-and-Resources), launched in September; 
- Support for trainers in developing countries to produce locally relevant courses along with online learning modules through the [GreenVoyage2050](https://greenvoyage2050.imo.org/) Programme;  
- Platforms to connect regulators and practitioners, such as a recent [seminar](https://www.imo.org/en/mediacentre/pages/whatsnew-2297.aspx) in Singapore showcasing practical training innovations from simulators and VR tools to methanol firefighting exercises. 

**A just and prepared transition** 

With new training standards, enhanced technical support for Member States and closer engagement with industry and academia, IMO is laying the groundwork for a just and well-prepared energy transition for seafarers.
