SOLAS Chapter VI, Part C requires cargo ships carrying grain on an international voyage to comply with the requirements of the International Grain Code. These requirements include the ship needing to have a grain loading manual approved by the Administration or a Recognised Organisation.

The IMO has now published amendments to the International Grain Code, which enter into force on 1 January 2026. Introduced by IMO resolution MSC.552(108), the amendments include a new loading condition for special compartments. 

**Grain Code loading conditions** 

The grain code currently includes the following loading conditions: 
</div>

- Filled compartments, trimmed 
- Filled compartments, untrimmed 
- Partly filled compartments 

<div className='news-paragraph'>
The code amendments now define a new, optional loading condition: 
</div>

- Specially suitable compartment, partly filled in way of the hatch opening, with ends untrimmed (see figure below):
