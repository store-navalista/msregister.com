A recent study and claims analysis carried out by the Japan P&I club over a 5 year period
between 2016 and 2020 shows that out of the 161 claims that were reported,
76% consisted of wetting damage to grain, steel and ore cargoes.
In 74 cases (46%), the sea water damage was caused by leaking hatch covers. This once
again shows that hatch covers continue to generate seawater induced claims and that improperly
maintained and leaky hatch covers have a high claim potential.

When water susceptible cargo comes in contact with seawater during an ocean passage, it is most likely that a claim for wetting damage will be filed against the ship by the cargo owners/receivers.

These claims generally consist of a fi nancial compensation for the damaged cargo, but indirect consequences associated with wetting damage claims, such as extra work for legal staff , survey costs, delays, sorting and reconditioning of the damaged cargo, unscheduled repairs to hatch covers, reputation damage, disruption of the ship’s operational schedule, travel costs for superintendents, … can be signifi cant as well. Whenever a claim for damage to 3rd party property is introduced, it is incumbent on the club to defend the owners’ interests and successful settling will mainly depend on proving that the hatch covers were well maintained and that the shipowner and Master exercised due diligence to ensure that the hatch covers were in good condition at the outset of the voyage. It is sad to see that many of the claims fi led for wetting damage could have been successfully defended and settled if only the owners and crew would have carried out basic hatch cover maintenance in line with good industry practice. The seas and oceans are a hostile environment and rigours of an ocean voyage should never be underestimated. Hatch covers are designed to withstand the perils of the sea but only when they are well maintained, they will be able to keep water out and cargoes dry. Despite awareness campaigns in the past, hatch covers remain a major driver for wetting damage claims. Water infi ltration may not only be a safety issue for the vessel and crew on board, but it also scuttles the business model of carrying goods by sea and should be avoided at all times.

The importance of correct hatch cover operation, maintenance and repairs cannot be emphasized enough. This loss prevention article, written by industry leading expert Mr. Walter Vervloesem (FNI) of IMCS bv (Belgium), will highlight key issues that should be well understood and observed in order to reduce exposure to ingress, wetting damage claims and to allow the club to defend your interest with success.

Experience has revealed that, when testing and inspecting hatch covers, the following typical or frequently seen mistakes are identifi ed below.

### CONCLUSIN.

<div className='news-paragraph'>
Hatch cover maintenance and operation requires a thorough understanding of basic principles together with type specifi c issues and requirements. Experience and claims show that hatch cover problems still remain one of the predominant causes for claims and accidents on board vessels. Whilst hatch cover claims are generally associated with wetting damage, it should not be overlooked that incorrect maintenance or operation may involve loss of life and limb or pollution. Moreover, claims for wet damaged cargo, pollution or accidents and injuries will always have an adverse impact on the owner’s business model. To avoid hatch cover related claims, owners should consider setting up dedicated training and familiarization programmes related to occupational safety, operation and inspection. Relevant and type specifi c hatch cover checklists should be made and their use implemented.
