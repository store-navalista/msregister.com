## MRV Maritime and EU ETS rules implementation

<div className='news-paragraph'>
**MRV Maritime Regulation from 01.01.2025 for General cargo ship 400-4999 GT, Passenger, Cargo and Offshore ships from 5000GT. The following emissions are covered – Carbon dioxide, Methane, Nitrous oxide.**

Since 1 January 2018, the maritime transport sector has been obliged to monitor and report emissions in accordance with the MRV Maritime Regulation2. Under this regulation, shipping companies have to provide monitoring plans, emissions reports and verification reports, for each of the ships under their responsibility. Shipping companies have to monitor, for each of their ships, greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption and other parameters, such as distance travelled, time at sea and cargo carried on a per voyage basis, so as to gather annual data into an emissions report verified by an accredited MRV Maritime verifier. Shipping companies must, through THETIS-MRV, submit to their responsible admin-istering authority, the Commission and to the authorities of their flag State (in case ships are flying the flag of a Member State) a satisfactorily verified Emissions Report (ER) for each ship that has performed maritime transport activities in the European Economic Area in the previous reporting period (calendar year).

**EU ETS from 2024 onwards for Cargo and Passenger ships from 5000 GT. Offshore ships more 5000 GT from 2027. General cargo and offshore ships 400-4999 GT planned for 2026. The following emission covered – Carbon dioxide. Form 2026 – Methane and Nitrous oxide.**

From 2024, they also need to provide data on a per company basis, with additional data reported for the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS3), providing an aggregated report of all their ships’ emissions derived from the data monitored under the MRV Maritime Regulation. For this purpose, only one single process of monitoring and reporting is required, although the data to be reported within the EU ETS may deviate, to a certain extent, from those to be reported under the MRV Maritime Regulation, e.g. regarding the scope (GHG gases, coverage of voyages), and the different applicable derogations as established by the EU ETS Directive. 

**Compliance**

Under the MRV Maritime Regulation, shipping companies are in compliance if they fulfil the obligation to submit a verified emissions report in time and if the relevant ships which carried out activities within scope of the Regulation have a valid Document of Compliance (“DoC”) on board. Under the EU ETS, however, shipping companies have to purchase and surrender (use) EU ETS emission allowances for each tonne of reported CO2 (or CO2 equivalent for the activities after 1 January 2026) as emitted under the scope of the EU ETS. Emissions from maritime transport are included in the overall ETS cap, which defines the maximum amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted under the system. The cap is reduced over time to ensure that all ETS sectors cumulatively contribute to the EU’s climate objectives.
